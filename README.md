# Code-Quiz
I created an html-5 file in the index.html forlder and took the script tag into it
Added another script tag in html folder to communicate with js and js questions
Created divs in html to control buttons
Went over to js file to creat elements
First I hooked the display question element then hooked the timer elements 
Then I created a var to element for results
I have spent hours attempting to code the js I am stuck at the start button to hide. 
I added so many things that i forgot what i did since my last insertion
my start button didn't work then it didn't and i could get past that so i did all my questions
instead.
This is very difficult as my site broke and I don't know where to begin with fixing it
So I coulndt get anythnig to work
My buttons don't work and I have no idea what I am doing.
I feel like i did the right functions
I am just not sure where to put the codes. I dont think they are in the right place.
I watched a lot of videos including the class vids to recap, but i feel lost.
This is the most difficult thing I have had to do academically, but I am not giving up.
I changed up my whole game.
I was not happy with the orignal code
I deleted and started from scratch
my formatting is all wrong
 alot to decipher and organize
 I hand wrote in the beginning and realized I must write down digitally to have proper documents
 so I am going back to the beginning andit slowing me down in the process
 I am grateful for the review but there is more I have to process 
 My button is getting better and the quiz is excelllent if i can jsut get it to work
 I am grateful to JP who is so gracious to help us all with our homework
 I am grateful to Katie who is always there
 Still having a diffucult time with this button issue. 

 I am rewriting this all over again. I have spent a day on this trying to figure out how to make the buttons work
 I learned about rem in my research
 I finally figured out the button issue and where I was going wrong
 I finnally go t the opening page to function right
