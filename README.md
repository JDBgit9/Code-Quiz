# Code-Quiz
I created an html-5 file in the index.html forlder and took the script tag into it
Added another script tag in html folder to communicate with js and js questions
Created divs in html to control buttons
Went over to js file to creat elements
First I hooked the display question element then hooked the timer elements 
Then I created a var to element for results
I have spent hours attempting to code the js I am stuck at the start button to hide. 
I added so many things that i forgot what i did since my last insertion
my start button didn't work then it didn't and i could get past that so i did all my questions
instead.
This is very difficult as my site broke and I don't know where to begin with fixing it
So I coulndt get anythnig to work
My buttons don't work and I have no idea what I am doing.
I feel like i did the right functions
I am just not sure where to put the codes. I dont think they are in the right place.
I watched a lot of videos including the class vids to recap, but i feel lost.
This is the most difficult thing I have had to do academically, but I am not giving up.
I changed up my whole game.
I was not happy with the orignal code
I deleted and started from scratch
my formatting is all wrong
 alot to decipher and organize
 I hand wrote in the beginning and realized I must write down digitally to have proper documents
 so I am going back to the beginning andit slowing me down in the process
 I am grateful for the review but there is more I have to process 
 My button is getting better and the quiz is excelllent if i can jsut get it to work
 I am grateful to JP who is so gracious to help us all with our homework
 I am grateful to Katie who is always there
 Still having a diffucult time with this button issue. 

 I am rewriting this all over again. I have spent a day on this trying to figure out how to make the buttons work
 I learned about rem in my research
 I finally figured out the button issue and where I was going wrong
 I finnally go t the opening page to function right
 This is far as I could get with this I just need more time. This is all new to me and I am taking a lot of information that I need to organize. Not to mention that I have other things going on at home and every arranging my room to be more adequate for this set up. I have been at this all weekend and a racing and starting over again and watching videos done everything I can to try to understand this and make it work but it is proving more difficult than I anticipated. I couldn't get the Chess to work right and the consol is always coming up with errors I got through that and figure some things out but then one thing led to another. There is a lot of problem-solving in this and learning a completely new language at the same time as taking in all this information is quite a task and I have no idea what I was get myself into. I had to go back to video one in the first class you just get the basics of the language in terms of the codes. I had to not host any more zoom calls because I need to focus solely on this and I have been making progress although I do miss the study group vibe. I would be more in fall if I was so far behind I do understand most of what's going on but putting it into application is very difficult without a tutor and private special attention I guess. 
 This is as far as I got in I'm a bit embarrassed because I know I can do better if I had more time. This is taking three days of me studying about eight hours a day and I'm still not barreling through like some of the other students are. Not that I'm comparing myself but I am an artist and I have not use this side of my brain in a long time.
 I am taking a vantage of the tutoring and will be doing more so because the one I want to tension is what I need most. To walk me through things and to help me Juliet into my system. I got the first page to look good I got to the buttons to
